        <!-- Hobbies Section -->
        <div id="hobbies" class="section">
            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Hobbies play an essential role in my life, allowing me to explore my interests and unwind from my academic responsibilities. My passion for technology fuels my curiosity, driving me to dive into new programming tools and the latest trends in the tech world. I often find myself spending hours researching innovations, experimenting with new coding languages, and exploring various software development techniques. This insatiable curiosity not only enhances my technical skills but also cultivates a mindset geared toward lifelong learning, which I consider vital in todayâ€™s fast-evolving digital landscape.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to technology, I am an avid sports enthusiast. Engaging in sports such as badminton, futsal, swimming, and football keeps me physically active while providing an opportunity to bond with friends. Each game is more than just a competition; it's a chance to build camaraderie, strategize, and enjoy the thrill of teamwork. I find immense joy in the adrenaline rush of a close match and the satisfaction of improving my skills over time. Additionally, I enjoy playing video games as a form of relaxation and entertainment. These games allow me to immerse myself in different worlds, challenge my strategic thinking, and connect with friends, often turning a simple game night into a memorable experience.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, my hobbies reflect my adventurous spirit and desire for personal growth. I am also a car enthusiast, particularly fond of the iconic 911 car, which represents engineering excellence and performance. My interest extends to watches as well, appreciating the craftsmanship and technology behind each piece. Exploring new technologies and engaging in sports instills a sense of discipline and perseverance within me. Whether it's pushing my limits on the badminton court or learning a new programming framework, I embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. My love for photography complements these interests, as I often document my adventures and memorable moments during travels and outings. Capturing the beauty of the world through my lens allows me to express my creativity and reflect on experiences that shape who I am. In essence, my hobbies enrich my life, providing a balance between relaxation, personal development, and social interaction.</p>

        <!-- Campus Life Section -->
        <div id="campus-life" class="section">
            <h2>My Campus Life</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">My journey at UTHM has been a transformative experience, filled with opportunities for personal and professional growth. One of the most memorable highlights was participating in the <b>UTHM Hackathon</b>, where my team and I embarked on an exciting challenge to build a mobile app prototype within a limited timeframe. This high-pressure environment taught me the importance of teamwork, creativity, and effective time management as we collaborated intensely to bring our idea to fruition. The experience not only sharpened my coding skills but also bolstered my confidence, proving that I could contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the hackathon, I had the privilege of joining a <b>Laravel bootcamp</b> with my instructor, which significantly enhanced my understanding of web development. This intensive course provided a hands-on experience, allowing me to dive deep into the Laravel framework and explore its powerful capabilities. Learning alongside passionate peers in a supportive environment inspired me to push my boundaries and strive for excellence. Although I didn't participate in an industrial visit to Intel in Penang, I sought other practical learning experiences that enriched my knowledge of the tech industry, such as attending workshops and networking events.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Volunteering at blood donation drives organized by the university was another rewarding aspect of my campus life. Contributing to a cause that directly impacts the community reinforced my belief in the importance of giving back and made me appreciate the collective effort involved in such initiatives. Additionally, I cherished the moments spent with friends during our trip to Langkawi over the semester break. This adventure was a perfect blend of relaxation and exploration, creating lasting memories that I will carry with me long after graduation. Overall, my campus life has been a vibrant tapestry of learning, growth, and meaningful connections that continue to shape my journey.</p>
